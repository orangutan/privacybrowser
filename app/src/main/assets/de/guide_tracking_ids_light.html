        <p>A few years ago the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) created a mechanism for browsers to inform web servers that they would not like to be tracked.
            This is accomplished by including a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">DNT (Do Not Track) header</a> with web requests.</p>

        <p>The DNT header doesn't really provide any privacy because most web servers ignore it. For example, Yahoo, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook all ignore at least some DNT headers.</p>
