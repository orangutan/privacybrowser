        <h3><img class="title" src="../shared_images/location_off_blue_light.png"> Do Not Track</h3>

        <p>A few years ago the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) created a mechanism for browsers to inform web servers that they would not like to be tracked.
            This is accomplished by including a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">DNT (Do Not Track) header</a> with web requests.</p>

        <p>The DNT header doesn't really provide any privacy because most web servers ignore it. For example, Yahoo, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook all ignore at least some DNT headers.</p>


        <h3><img class="title" src="../shared_images/link_off_blue_light.png"> URL Modification</h3>

        <p>Privacy Browser removes tracking ID sections of URLs, like <code>?utm_</code> from <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867">Google Analytics</a> and
            <code>?fbclick=</code> from <a href="https://fbclid.com/">Facebook</a>. URL modification can be turned off in the settings if it is causing issues.</p>
