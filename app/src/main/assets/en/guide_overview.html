        <h3>True Privacy</h3>

        <p>Privacy Browser is designed to let you take as much control of your privacy as possible while still browsing the internet.
            When a browser connects to a website, certain pieces of information which are necessary to facilitate the connection are transferred to the server.
            For example, the server will receive your IP address and a port number, which are necessary for it to know where to send the response.
            This information is often logged by the server, allowing the website developer to produce reports showing how often a webpage was loaded and how many different IP addresses accessed it.</p>

        <p>However, most website operators want more information about their visitors, including tracking their web browsing across multiple websites.
            There use many different techniques, including requesting or placing extra information on a user&rsquo;s device, that facilitate this tracking.
            Almost all browsers will voluntarily participate in this tracking without informing the user they are doing so.
            Privacy Browser is designed to grant the user as much information and control over these tracking techniques as possible.</p>


        <h3>Android&rsquo;s WebView Limitations</h3>

        <p>Privacy Browser uses Android&rsquo;s built-in WebView to render websites. There are some limitations in the controls WebView exposes for managing privacy settings.
            For example, it isn&rsquo;t possible to enable some JavaScript commands while disabling others. In the future, Privacy Browser will switch to a custom WebView called <a href="https://www.stoutner.com/february-2017-roadmap/">Privacy WebView</a>.</p>
