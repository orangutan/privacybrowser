Privacy Browser protects your privacy by disabling features like JavaScript, DOM storage, and cookies that are used by websites to track users.  Settings can be adjusted by domain and on-the-fly to enable these features when needed.  In addition, Privacy Browser incorporates the EasyList block lists, which block many tracking technologies even when JavaScript is enabled.

Privacy Browser does not have tabbed browsing yet.  This is a planned feature for the 3.x series.

Privacy Browser currently uses Android’s built-in WebView to render web pages.  As such, it works best when the latest version of WebView is installed.  In the 4.x series, Privacy Browser will switch to a forked version of Android’s WebView called Privacy WebView that will allow for advanced privacy features.

Warning: Due to limitations in the OS, Privacy Browser is susceptible to MITM (Man In The Middle) attacks when browsing insecure websites from devices running Android KitKat (version 4.4.x, API 19).  More information about this issue is available at https://www.stoutner.com/kitkat-security-problems/.
