Privacy Browser protects your privacy by disabling JavaScript, DOM storage, and cookies by default, but providing quick methods to enable them for websites where they are required. Many websites use these technologies to track users between visits and across sites.

Privacy Browser uses Android's built-in WebView to render web pages.  As such, it works best if you have updated to the latest version of WebView.

Warning: Privacy Browser is susceptible to
